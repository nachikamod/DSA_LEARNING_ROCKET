* ADT(Abstract Data Types)
  
  When the program is heirarchical organized then the main program utilizes services which is appearing at level 1. Similarly, functions written at level 1 utilizes services which is written at level 2 (Inheritance). This is called a level of abstraction. Abstraction means *what it can do* and not *how it is done*. Example, libraries, header files, etc. Abstraction defines the behaviour or operation of specific function.  


***Static Memory Allocation***

  Static memory allocation is done by the compiler during compilation.
 
***Dynamic Memory Allocation***

  Dynamic memory allocation is done by the user at the time of execution. The memory size is calculated at the time of execution and then the space is allocated for the data. Example, allocation of size of array at the time of execution.
