***ADT(Abstract Data Types)***
  
  When the program is heirarchical organized then the main program utilizes services which is appearing at level 1. Similarly, functions written at level 1 utilizes services which is written at level 2 (Inheritance). This is called a level of abstraction. Abstraction means *what it can do* and not *how it is done*. Example, libraries, header files, etc. Abstraction defines the behaviour or operation of specific function.
